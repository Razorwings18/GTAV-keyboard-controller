# GTAV-keyboard-controller
Easier way to check for key combinations in GTA V with ScriptHookVdotNET. See heading comments for instructions. Makes sure you can differentiate between LEFT and RIGHT modifier keys (e.g., LControlKey and RControlKey instead of just ControlKey). Also makes sure you don't activate stuff if you are NOT expecting a key combination (i.e., usually you'll see scripts where a feature is activated by pressing, say, just "C"; but if you press "Ctrl-C" the feature will still get activated. This prevents that. Pass KeyCode.None as a modifier if you feature does not use modifiers.)
